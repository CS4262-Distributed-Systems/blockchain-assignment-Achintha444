# Learned Blockchain Concepts

## 1. Decentralization of the Ledger
Blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transaction. When this ledger gets decentralized it becomes immutable and open. Also this leads to some issues like double spending problem, hence we need to have ways to overcome such difficulties.

## 2. Proof of Work
Proof of work is a mechanism which allows to confirm a transaction thus adding a new block to the chain. Normally proof of work are puzzles which are harder to compute but easy to check.
